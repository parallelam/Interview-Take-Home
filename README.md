A minor-project for a take-home assignment from an interview. Experimenting with new NPM dependencies for minimalist handling of large CSV data dumps, among other self-refreshers for CLI applications, such as inquirer, fs, csv, csvtojson, nodemon, dotenv, pg and features associated with the Postgres style SQL database.

Deployed (incomplete, and not functioning) on Heroku at: https://ndsl-tinkering.herokuapp.com/

Will upon completion write out the Readme.md for usage and possibly add some CLI script features.
